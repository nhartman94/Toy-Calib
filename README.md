# README

**Goal:** Collecting some notebooks for exploring (?)


## Dataset

We plan to _start_ with the dataset from Matthias in [cernbox](https://cernbox.cern.ch/files/link/public/EDo8Z9FY1ZOewZT?tiles-size=1&items-per-page=100&view-mode=resource-table)

Michael was proposing as **step 1** to just get a calibration pipeline for signal

**To do:**
- [ ] Francesco / Lucio: sort out a strategy to perturb our signal ("fake" data for our sig/bkg files), e.g, F mentioned
    *  Smearing
    * Dropping tracks
- [ ] Nicole: Test out idea for morphing H(bb) -> Z(bb) (just a way to modify our nominal signal sample)

## Correction models

- [ ] Matthias / Lucio: Test out idea for morphing H(bb) -> Z(bb)
- [ ] Nicole / Matthias: Normalizing Flows and CNF for (?) 
- [ ] Francesco / Nicole: Implicit layers in jax for fitting the ratio of two histograms 


## Next steps

- Include bkg in the training
- Point-like vs. amortized calib ...
